<h1>Company History</h1>
<p>Ris Build Ltd was founded in 2011 by R.I.Sapundzhiev, who has over 20 years experience managing
    large construction projects. Prior to starting Diversity Construction Group, he was responsible for managing the
    set-aside program for the City of Hartford that yielded over $100 million dollars of contracts being awarded to
    set-aside firms on a first tier basis. He was instrumental in developing a program that eliminated the bonding
    requirement and also expedited the payment process to assist set-aside firms.</p>
<p>He found that several factors contributed to this problem. The single biggest issue for minority-owned firms was not
    being able to generate enough business to sustain the overhead required to satisfy the more sophisticated client.
    For minority firms these sophisticated clients are typically the larger construction managers, general contractors
    and subcontracts that seek to hire minority-owned businesses.</p>
